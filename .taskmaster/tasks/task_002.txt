# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Backend WebSocket Server
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the WebSocket server in the backend to handle real-time communication between the frontend and the backend services.
# Details:
1. Create WebSocket endpoint in FastAPI:
```python
@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    try:
        while True:
            # Receive audio data from frontend
            data = await websocket.receive_bytes()
            # Process data (will be implemented in subsequent tasks)
            # Send response back to frontend
            await websocket.send_bytes(response_data)
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        logger.info("WebSocket disconnected")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"WebSocket error: {str(e)}")
        await websocket.close()
```

2. Implement connection manager to handle multiple concurrent WebSocket connections:
```python
class ConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_connections: List[WebSocket] = []

    async def connect(self, websocket: WebSocket):
        await websocket.accept()
        self.active_connections.append(websocket)

    def disconnect(self, websocket: WebSocket):
        self.active_connections.remove(websocket)

    async def send_bytes(self, message: bytes, websocket: WebSocket):
        await websocket.send_bytes(message)
```

3. Implement error handling and reconnection logic
4. Add logging for connection events and errors
5. Create basic message protocol for different types of messages (audio data, text, status updates)

# Test Strategy:
1. Use WebSocket testing tools (like Postman or wscat) to verify connection establishment
2. Test sending and receiving binary data through the WebSocket
3. Verify proper error handling when connection is interrupted
4. Test multiple concurrent connections
5. Validate logging of connection events

# Subtasks:
## 1. Refactor existing WebSocket endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modularize the existing /ws/voice endpoint in main.py to improve code organization and maintainability.
### Details:
Move the WebSocket logic to a separate module (e.g., websocket_handler.py). Create a WebSocketHandler class to encapsulate the endpoint functionality. Update main.py to use the new WebSocketHandler.

# Refactoring Completed Successfully!

## Implementation Details:

### 1. Created `websocket_handler.py`
- `WebSocketHandler` class encapsulates all WebSocket logic
- Methods organized by responsibility:
  - `handle_connection()`: Manages connection lifecycle
  - `_process_message()`: Routes messages by type
  - `_handle_text_message()` / `_handle_audio_message()`: Type-specific processing
  - `_send_error_response()`: Standardized error handling
  - `get_connection_count()`: Connection monitoring

### 2. Refactored `main.py`
- Removed inline WebSocket logic (was 40+ lines)
- Now uses `WebSocketHandler` (just 1 line at the endpoint)
- Added connection counter to `/health` endpoint
- Code is much cleaner and more maintainable

### 3. Improvements Implemented:
- **Modularization**: Clear separation of responsibilities
- **Enhanced logging**: Connection counters and better tracking
- **Error handling**: Standardized error responses
- **Precise timestamps**: ISO format with UTC
- **Monitoring**: Active connection counter

The structure is now ready for the upcoming subtasks (ConnectionManager, structured protocol, etc.)

## 2. Implement ConnectionManager class [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a ConnectionManager class to handle multiple concurrent WebSocket connections efficiently.
